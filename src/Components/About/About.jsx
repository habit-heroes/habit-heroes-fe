            <p className='about-detail'>
                Laurel Cowans: Hi! I’m Laurel from Texas! I started software development in January of 2024 and it’s become one of my favorite things. Before software development, I was a medic in the U.S. Army. I was inspired to pitch and create Habit Hero because I’ve noticed my daily life feels better when I complete certain tasks. I wanted to make this application as customizable as possible because I know daily habits are personal and everyone needs different things. I hope you love this application as much as I do and it helps improve your daily life! 
                </p>

                Grant Davis: Hi everyone, I’m Grant and I live in Colorado! Before I started my professional journey in tech, I worked as the Marketing Coordinator for a non-profit. I really enjoy working with databases and managing the logic that helps make applications simple and easy-to-use.

                Brandon Doza: Hi there! I am a Denver Colorado based software developer. Previously I was a loan officer in the mortgage industry, which taught me to be detail oriented, and focused on clients' individual needs. I was drawn to software because of my love for building things and helping people. I am passionate about making the web accessible to everyone.
